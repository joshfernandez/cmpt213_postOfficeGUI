# CMPT 213 - Assignment 5: Post Office Graphical User Interface
A post office interface using Java's Swing libraries and AWT frameworks to manage different post office operations such as sending, transiting, receiving, and throwing away letters and packages for my CMPT 213 (Object-Oriented Design in Java) class.

Specific tasks included:

* Organizing the layout of the interface using Java Swing's GridBagLayout class to maintain flexibility in using the interface between various monitors and operating systems
* Handling GUI actions by customizing an action event and listener to invoke different objects in the program and specify their communication with the main window

This was an assignment managed by Prof. Karol Swietlicki to challenge my CMPT 213 class in our GUI design skills.
